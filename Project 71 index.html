                         <p class="p_modal">The junior, middle and senior school libraries are located centrally in the school to facilitate ease of access. The libraries have a great collection of fiction, non-fiction and reference books. A wide range of books aim to help children discover the joy of reading. An extensive reference section helps them work on multi-dimensional projects. In addition, there are resource books for teachers to help them keep updated with new advancements in the field of education and their respective subjects. The goal of the school library is to ensure that all members of the school get equitable access to books.<br>

It has a fully equipped kitchen and serves hygienic food to the students. The menu ranges from South Indian to Chinese. A committee comprising of parent reps and staff are responsible for its close supervision. The Canteen Committee meets regularly to inspect the premises as well as discuss the menu. All biodegradable food is regularly put in the compost pit behind the canteen. The canteen uses steel utensils only and has done away with all single use plastic containers. A CCTV placed inside the kitchen allows for regular surveillance and maintenance of hygiene standards. Break time sees the students in large numbers engaged in discussions and enjoying the food served in the canteen. It is the favourite place of Sanskritians, staff and students alike." <br>

Built strategically in the very centre of the school, it is the place where all assemblies and special ceremonies, such as prize distributions, citation for the graduating batch of Class XII, investiture ceremony and other such events are held.
                             The amphitheatre can seat around 600 people and the circular stage can easily accommodate 50 to 60 children during a performance. During winters, one can also see small groups of students studying with teachers on the steps of the amphitheatre as they enjoy the sun.<br>

                     2021 on Saturday, 12th December 2020. The Olympiad was held online for the first
                     time in history. Students from all over the world appeared for the examination. The
                     results were declared on Thursday, 25 February. The participants are tested on word
                     and structure knowledge, comprehension, spoken and written expression etc. Due to
                     the unprecedented circumstances, the contestants only had to give one round of the
                     Olympiad. The students of Sanskriti School performed exceptionally well, with Aayra
                     Dhindsa Sawkmie of class 6-C securing International Rank 1 with a score of 60/60.
                     The school is very proud of this achievement and extends congratulations to all the
                     participants.</p>
